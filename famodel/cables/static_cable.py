class StaticCable(Edge):
    '''
    Class for a static power cable. It inherits from Cable(Edge, dict)
    which describes the bare uniform cable before accessories are added.
    A StaticCable object will likely be within a SubseaCable object, which could
    also include a DynamicCable.
    Both ends will be attached to subsea joints.
    The main thing done by this class is describing the cable routing on the
    seabed.
