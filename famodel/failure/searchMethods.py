   breadth_first_child Documentation
 -----------------------------------
 This method takes in an adjacency matrix, list of node names, and an integer indicating te starting node. We 
 traverse through the graph. For each generation, starting from the source node, we find and add all the children
 of the nodes in this generation, unless the node has aldready been placed in the tree. As such, we create a tree. 
 This method returns this tree, the tree's adjacency matrix, a dictionary of nodes, and arrays for effects and modes.
 
 --> Note: a tree is a graph with no cycles or loops. It does not have to be directed, but it is acyclic.'''

        # since the only non zero entry in the j-1 column of the diagonal matrix is j (located on the diagonal), then
        # the entry in the j-1 column of the returned vector will be j. However, if the jth node is not a child of
        # the current node, then there is a zero in the j-1 column of the current row of the adjacency matrix. When
        # multiplied by the diagonal matrix, this zero is multiplied by every entry in the j-1 column of the diagonal
