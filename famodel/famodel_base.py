'''
famodel_base contains base classes that can be used for various classes
in the floating array model that relate to entities that act like either
nodes (represented by a single point in space) or edges (that run between
two nodes). The base Node and Edge classes and their methods provide the
functionality for representing 2D positions and relationships between
objects that can be used by many other classes.

Both edges and nodes keep registers of their attachments. This results in
duplicate information, meaning consistency is critical. For consistency 
with MoorPy and MoorDyn, actual attachments or detachments are controlled 
by a Node method. It then also calls the subordinate Edge or Node method. 
The registries are as follows:
'attachments' lists other objects that are bound to the present Node object.
'attached_to' states what object the present Edge end or Node is bound to. 
Each of the above is a dict of dicts, for now, where the key is the id of
the attached object, and the value is a dictionary of more info such as the
object reference, type, and any relative offset...

Linear assemblies of edges and nodes can be grouped into a higher-level
edge object. This allows mooring line sections and connectors to be 
part of an overall mooring line object, which is itself an edge. These 
relationships are tracked with sub_edge and sub_node lists in the 
higher-level Edge object, and part_of entries in the lower-level node or edge
objects.

class Node():
    '''A base class for objects that have a single spatial reference point and

            'r_rel' :  ,  #
            'type'  :     # Node or Edge
    
    
    For grouped/multilevel edges, connections are stored at the highest level,
    so 'ref' would be to the highest level edge object.
