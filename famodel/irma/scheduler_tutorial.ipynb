    "üìã **Many Tasks**: Discrete work activities that need to be completed (e.g., anchor installation, cable laying)  \n",

    "As an example, let's say you own a truck delivery company with 3 trucks and you need to decide which trucks to send out for delivery, where each truck ($x_i$) has a cost of delivery and a time duration. The goal is to minimize cost of delivery, under a constraint that the total delivery time needs to be at least 12 hours. The only decisions are to either send out the truck for delivery (1) or not (0).\n",
