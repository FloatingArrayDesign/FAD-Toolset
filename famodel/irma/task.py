class Task():
    '''
    A Task is a general representation of a set of marine operations
    that follow a predefined sequence/strategy. There can be multiple
    tasks that achieve the same end, each providing an alternative strategy.
    Each Task consists of a set of Actions with internal dependencies.
    
    
    For now, we'll assume each Task must be port-to-port,
    i.e. its vessel(s) must start and end at port over the course of the task.
