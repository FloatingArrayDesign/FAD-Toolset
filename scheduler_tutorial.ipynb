    "## IRMA Scheduler Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Interactive Tutorial for the **IRMA (Installation Resource Management & Analytics) Scheduler**!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to guide new users/readers through the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) of the scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Imagine you are planning the schedule of installation activities for the deployment of an offshore system. \n",
    "\n",
    "üìã **Many Tasks**: Discrete work activities that need to be completed (e.g., anchor installation, cable laying)  \n",
    "üö¢ **Multiple Assets**: Resources (typically vessels) that can perform certain Tasks based on their capabilities (e.g., heavy-lift vessel, cable-laying vessel, support vessel)  \n",
    "‚öôÔ∏è **Task-Asset Assignments**: Multiple Assets can be assigned to each Task, where each assignment has an associated cost and time duration  \n",
    "üåä **Weather Windows**: Assets can only work in suitable sea conditions (e.g., wind speed limits, wave height limits)  \n",
    "üí∞ **Time and Cost**: The schedule should aim to minimize the total cost of all tasks performed\n",
    "\n",
    "How can the scheduler figure out what assets to assign to what tasks and when to perform each task to minimize time and/or cost?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)\n",
    "\n",
    "A type of optimization problem that uses a mixture of integer, binary, and continuous variables subject to linear constraints to minimize an objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's say you own a truck delivery company with 3 trucks and you need to decide which trucks to send out for delivery, where each truck (x_i) has a cost of delivery and a time duration. The goal is to minimize cost of delivery, under a constraint that the total delivery time needs to be at least 12 hours. The only decisions are to either send out the truck for delivery (1) or not (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimize \n",
    "$$ 500x_1 + 400x_2 + 300x_3 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 7x_1 + 6x_2 + 4x_3 \\geq 12 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "A MILP solver will realize that it needs at least two trucks for delivery and also figure out that Truck 2 ($x_2$) and Truck 3 ($x_3$) will not satisfy the constraint and neither will Truck 1 ($x_1$) and Truck 3 ($x_3$). That leaves the options of Truck 1 and Truck 2, or all three trucks. It will choose only Truck 1 and Truck 2 since that minimizes cost. (This also assumes that each truck can only be used once).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial only considers binary variables (for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\in \\{0,1\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "to determine what decisions to make to minimize the objective of the scheduler."
